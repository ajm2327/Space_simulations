# Space_simulations
These are silly little pygames I've made, they don't accurately represent any locations in space, 
but the universe is so vast so who knows? 

To run these, you should have these following packages, possibly others: 
pygame
math
random

Aside from pygame, the other packages should naturally come with your python installation.
